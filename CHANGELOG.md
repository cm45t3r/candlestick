# Changelog

## [v1.0.2](https://github.com/cm45t3r/candlestick/tree/v1.0.2) (2025-07-25)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/cm45t3r/candlestick/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2)

**Improvements & Refactors:**

- Refactored all pattern modules to remove redundant `require('./utils.js')` calls; now use imported utilities directly.
- Consolidated duplicate `isEngulfed` logic: only the utility version is used across the codebase.
- Added `paramCount` to all multi-candle patterns in `patternChain` for correct match length in results.
- Refactored `patternChain` to precompute candle properties once per call, improving efficiency and consistency.
- Expanded and clarified tests:
  - Direct tests for all utility functions, including edge cases (doji, no range, negative/extreme values).
  - Added/updated tests for multi-candle pattern matches and edge cases in `patternChain`.
- Updated documentation:
  - README now includes explicit technical thresholds for patterns, performance tips, and a new FAQ.
  - Clarified that the library does not mutate input data.
  - Documented multi-candle match behavior and `paramCount` in pattern chaining.
- Cleaned up packaging:
  - Removed `test/` and non-existent `HISTORY.md` from npm package files.
  - Ensured only relevant documentation and source files are included.

**Other:**
- All tests pass and coverage is 100%.
