# Contributing to Candlestick

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your help is welcome and appreciated.

## How to Contribute

- **Bug Reports:** Please open an [issue](https://github.com/cm45t3r/candlestick/issues) with a clear description and, if possible, a minimal reproducible example.
- **Feature Requests:** Open an issue describing your idea and its use case.
- **Pull Requests:** Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request. Please describe your changes clearly.

## Coding Standards

- Use modern JavaScript (ES2020+).
- Keep code modular: each pattern or utility in its own file.
- Use descriptive names and add JSDoc comments to all exported functions.
- Follow the code style enforced by ESLint and Prettier.
- Ensure TypeScript definitions are updated for new functions (types/index.d.ts).
- Write tests for all new features (target 100% coverage).

## Running Tests

- Run all tests with:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Run tests in watch mode:
  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```
- Check test coverage:
  ```bash
  npm run coverage
  ```
- Add or update tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- 100% test coverage is expected for all modules.
- Include integration tests for complex features.

## Linting & Formatting

- Lint your code with:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- Fix lint errors automatically with:
  ```bash
  npm run lint -- --fix
  ```
- Code is formatted with Prettier. Please run your editorâ€™s formatter or use:
  ```bash
  npx prettier --write .
  ```

## Commit Messages

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information about the project structure and design patterns.

## Adding New Patterns

When adding a new pattern:

1. Create pattern module in `src/newPattern.js`
2. Follow existing pattern structure (is\*, array functions)
3. Add comprehensive tests in `test/newPattern.test.js`
4. Register in `src/candlestick.js`
5. Add to `src/patternChain.js` allPatterns array
6. Update TypeScript definitions in `types/index.d.ts`
7. Update README.md pattern descriptions
8. Add example in `examples/` if helpful

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed guidelines.
