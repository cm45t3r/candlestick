## Code Structure

### Issues
- The overall organization of the code could be improved for clarity and consistency. Currently, the pattern detection functions have inconsistent interfaces and return types. For example, some pattern functions return empty arrays while others produce `undefined`.
- The library does not support scanning an entire dataset for a sequence of patterns (a “pattern chain”) in one call.
- Important candlestick patterns like the Doji are missing entirely.
- These structural limitations make the library less comprehensive and harder to use as a whole.

### Recommendations
1. **Consistent Function Interface**  
   - Refactor pattern detection functions to have a consistent signature and return type.  
   - Decide whether each `isPatternName()` function should return a boolean for a single candle or accept an array and return an array of results.  
   - If some functions currently return arrays of matches and others return a single value or `undefined`, choose one approach and apply it across all patterns.  
   - Consider providing two sets of functions: one for evaluating a single candlestick (returning `true`/`false`) and another for scanning an array of candlesticks (returning an array of indices or booleans). Document these choices clearly.

2. **Modularize Patterns**  
   - Organize each candlestick pattern’s logic into its own module or function, rather than one large monolithic file.  
   - Group related patterns or utility calculations together (e.g., shared `bodyLength(candle)` utility).  
   - Avoid duplicating code to improve maintainability and ease of adding new patterns.

3. **Implement Missing Patterns and Chaining**  
   - Extend the codebase to cover missing common patterns like Doji.  
   - Design the architecture so adding a new pattern does not require modifying core logic in multiple places.  
   - Add a high-level function to scan an entire candlestick series and return a sequence of identified patterns (pattern chaining).  
   - Eliminate the need for users to write boilerplate loops, improving both usability and performance.

## Readability

### Issues
- Some function names are not immediately clear to users unfamiliar with technical analysis jargon. For example, a user had to ask if `isBullishHammer` and `isBearishHammer` were meant to detect bullish/bearish pinbar candles.
- There have been instances of leftover merge conflict markers in the repository (e.g., Git conflict strings in `package.json`) which impair readability.
- Complex pattern logic (like the engulfing pattern rules) might not be well-commented – a user pointed out a potential issue in the `isEngulfed` logic and suggested the correct conditions.

### Recommendations
- **Clear Naming and Comments**  
  - Use descriptive names for functions and variables that reflect their purpose in plain language.  
  - If a pattern has both a common name (e.g., “Pinbar”) and a technical name (“Hammer”), mention both in comments or documentation.  
  - Add comments above complex logic to explain the intent (e.g., describe the criteria for an engulfing pattern in words before the code).

- **Code Cleanliness**  
  - Ensure that no merge conflict markers or similar artifacts remain in the codebase.  
  - Adopt code reviews or use linters to catch these issues before committing.

- **Consistent Style and Formatting**  
  - Apply a consistent coding style throughout the project (indentation, bracket placement, naming conventions).  
  - Use tools like ESLint or Prettier to automate formatting and enforce conventions.

- **Inline Documentation for Logic**  
  - Provide inline explanations for non‑obvious business logic (e.g., “the candle’s body is less than 30% of the candle’s range”).  
  - Link to any external references or charts that illustrate pattern definitions.

## Performance

### Issues
- Users must manually loop or call functions repeatedly to identify patterns across a large dataset, since there’s no built‑in chaining API.
- Pattern functions often recompute the same metrics (e.g., body length, wick size) for overlapping patterns, causing unnecessary overhead.
- Inconsistent return structures (`undefined` vs. empty arrays) lead to extra checks or conversions in user code.

### Recommendations
1. **Single‑Pass Pattern Scanning**  
   - Introduce an API such as `findAllPatterns(candleSeries)` that scans the dataset in one pass and detects multiple patterns.

2. **Avoid Redundant Calculations**  
   - Precompute basic candle properties (body size, wick lengths, bullish/bearish flag) once per candle and cache them for reuse in each pattern check.

3. **Optimize Data Structures**  
   - Use efficient iteration over arrays of objects and minimize nested loops by handling look‑ahead/look‑behind pattern checks within a single pass.

4. **Benchmark and Profile**  
   - Include basic benchmarks for key functions (e.g., timing pattern detection on datasets of various sizes) to verify that refactors maintain or improve performance.

## Documentation

### Issues
- Users are unclear about what functions like `isBullishHammer`/`isBearishHammer` actually detect.
- Some pattern functions returning `undefined` left users unsure if that output was normal.
- An installation issue due to a naming conflict in `package.json` required a workaround, but wasn’t documented.

### Recommendations
- **Comprehensive README**  
  - Add or expand `README.md` with an overview, installation instructions (including the package name workaround), and usage examples showing how to import and call functions on sample candlestick data.

- **Document Each Pattern Function**  
  - Use JSDoc comments or a dedicated section in the README listing all supported patterns, their plain‑language descriptions, and return values.

- **Explain Return Values and Usage Notes**  
  - Clearly state what each function returns (boolean, array of indices, etc.) and how to interpret `undefined` or empty arrays.

- **Changelog and Roadmap**  
  - Maintain a changelog of released versions and a roadmap listing planned features (e.g., Doji support, pattern chaining) and known open issues.

- **Installation and Contribution Guide**  
  - Provide correct `npm install` commands and GitHub install instructions.  
  - Add a CONTRIBUTING guide explaining how to run tests, add new patterns, and follow style guidelines.

## Maintainability

### Issues
- Merge conflict artifacts (e.g., `<<<<<<< HEAD`) made it into the repository, indicating insufficient cleanup before commits.
- The test suite did not run cleanly (e.g., `npm test` errors), suggesting either failing tests or misconfigured scripts.
- Key features like Doji detection were absent, and bugs like the engulfing pattern logic were identified by users.

### Recommendations
1. **Improve Testing and CI**  
   - Strengthen the test suite to cover all patterns and edge cases, catching logic errors like `isEngulfed` issues early.  
   - Set up Continuous Integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on every commit or PR, and block merges if the suite fails.

2. **Code Reviews and Contribution Standards**  
   - Adopt mandatory code reviews or self-review checklists before committing to catch simple mistakes and ensure tests pass locally.

3. **Regular Maintenance Releases**  
   - Address open issues (Doji support, pattern chaining) in scheduled releases.  
   - Increment version numbers and document changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` or release notes.

4. **Refactor for Extensibility**  
   - Periodically refactor common logic into utilities and maintain a registry of pattern functions so adding new patterns is as simple as dropping in a new module.

5. **Leverage Type Annotations or TypeScript**  
   - Introduce JSDoc or migrate to TypeScript for type checking, making function contracts explicit and catching data‑shape errors at compile time.
